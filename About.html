        <H2>About Me</H2>
    
    <p>I am fascinated by how software technologies are used in the industry to further our technological growth worldwide.
    I have an interest in software development and systems. <br><br>
    I love learning about these topics and particularly how they will impact our current world going forward. For my future professional career, I plan to have a position as a software engineer at a reputable company where I can continue to learn new skills.
</p>
    <p>My current goal is to get an internship position that would help gain me the knowledge and insights into real-world working environments. I have applied retail skills from working in the industry for 4 years throughout senior high school and after.
    From this I have gained a high standard of communication with strong interpersonal skills. Outside of my studies I continuously work on sharping my technical skills relating to software development through completing personal projects.
    I have the ability to work individually or as a resourceful team member. I am keen to work with an organisation that shares my motivation to improve my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives.
